# Solution

    class Solution:
        def countPrime(self, n):
            """
            :type n: int
            :rtype: int
            """
            a = [False, False] + [True]*(n-1)
            primes = []           
            for i in range(2,n):
                if a[i]:

                for j in range(2*i, n+1, i):
                    a[j] = False

        n = 10
        print(s.countPrime(n))
